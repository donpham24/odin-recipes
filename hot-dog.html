    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 250-275F. In a medium-size bowl, mix ground beef and ground pork, and knead by hand until combined. 
        </li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, add binder flour, paprika, garlic powder, mustard powder, ground coriander, salt, brown sugar, and Prague powder; whisk until combined, then add water and mix thoroughly. Add the spice paste to your ground meat and mix until combined and homogenous. 
        </li>
        <li>Set your sheep casings on your stuffer casing attachment, and begin to stuff your sausages until you use all the meat. Pinch along the whole sausages to create 7” to 8” logs, twist the meat to tight them, and repeat with the rest. 
        </li>
        <li>Place the sausage links on a baking sheet and place them in the fridge uncovered overnight to dry. 
        </li>
        <li>Place the sausages on a wire rack, set them up on a baking sheet, and place them in the oven for 45 minutes or an internal temperature of 160F. Once cooked, immediately submerge in ice water to cool completely. 
        </li>
