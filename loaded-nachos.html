    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These homemade nachos have a presence on the table, and they’re real easy to make. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bag (20 counts) of yellow corn tortillas (cut into 8 piece triangles)</li>
        <li>1.5 quarts (1.4L) of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt to Taste</li>
        <li>1 rib of celery</li>
        <li>1/2 lb (227g) cremini mushrooms (minced)</li>
        <li>1/2 lb (227g) ground beef</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill up a heavy bottom pot just over halfway with vegetable oil. Heat to 350F, then add your chips in batches to avoid overcrowding and fry for 2 to 3 minutes; tossing occasionally. </li>
        <li>Remove with a spider, place on a baking sheet with a wire rack, and season with salt to taste while hot. Repeat with the rest of your tortillas.  </li>
        <li>To a 12” pan, add enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan, set over medium-high, and add all your mushrooms once hot. Let those cook, steering often, about 3 to 4 minutes or until their moisture has evaporated and they are starting to pick up some color—season to taste with salt. 
        </li>
        <li>Set the mushrooms to one side of the pan, add more oil to the pan if necessary, and add ground beef. Press it down, season with salt to taste, sear for around 2 minutes, flip, season with salt and pepper and let it sear for another 2 minutes. Using a potato masher, chop the beef until a fine crumble. 
        </li>
        <li>Mix the beef and the mushrooms, then mix in chipotle juices, pressing down through a fine mesh strainer. Add cumin (optional), then add garlic and mix it in.
        </li>
       
    </ol>
